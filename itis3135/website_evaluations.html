            <section>
              <h3>Good Website - <a href="https://stellar.org/">Stellar</a></h3>
              <p>Stellar is an ISO20022 compliant cryptocurrency that is pre-mined and has some of the best transaction speeds on the market, created by IBM.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: The website masterfully implements contrast through its black and white base with strategic yellow accents. Headlines stand out boldly against clean backgrounds, while the alternating dark and light sections create clear content separation. The text maintains excellent readability with appropriate contrast ratios throughout.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: Design elements are consistently applied across the site, including a unified modern sans-serif typography, standardized card layouts, and uniform button styles. The repetitive use of their icon style and illustration theme creates a cohesive visual language. Their grid pattern maintains consistency in how content is presented.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: The site employs a strong grid-based layout with precise column and row arrangements. Text blocks maintain consistent left alignment, while hero sections use centered alignment for impact. The modular system ensures every element has its proper place, creating a clean, professional appearance.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: Related content is thoughtfully grouped within distinct card sections, with appropriate spacing creating clear visual hierarchies. Navigation items are logically clustered in the header, and the footer content is organized into clear categorical groups. The spacing between headlines and body text enhances readability.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>
        
            <section>
              <h3>Bad Website - <a href="https://rizzmas.lol/">Rizzmas Solana Token</a></h3>
              <p>Rizzmas is a Solana meme coin that has a $20M marketcap and serves no purpose outside of commoditizing a meme into a tradeable coin.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: The website struggles with contrast issues, particularly in its use of light blue text on white backgrounds. The lack of sufficient contrast makes critical information difficult to read. Important elements like contract addresses and market data don't stand out effectively, and there's no clear visual hierarchy in how information is presented.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: The site lacks consistent design patterns, with varying typography between sections and inconsistent button styles. There's no unified approach to spacing or element styling, and the random use of emojis and icons creates visual noise rather than coherence. The absence of a clear design system makes the site feel unprofessional.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Elements appear arbitrarily placed without adherence to a grid system. Margins and padding vary throughout the site, and text alignment changes without apparent purpose. Critical components like contract addresses and wallet information lack proper formatting, while social media icons and links seem randomly arranged.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: The site fails to properly group related information, with critical data like contract addresses not clearly separated from marketing content. Sections feel overcrowded due to insufficient spacing, and there's poor organization of important metrics like market cap and liquidity. The lack of clear content hierarchy makes it difficult to understand relationships between different elements.</li>
              </ul>
